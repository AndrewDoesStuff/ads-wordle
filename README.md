# ADS-Wordle
A version of the game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) that I programmed in python as a fun side project.

This can be used with any-amount of letter words, but I wrote a short script to get only 5-letter, wordle-appropriate words, called `five-letter-words.py`

# Installation
1. Download the repository
2. *(Optional)* Run the `five-letter-words.py` file on the `words_alpha.txt` file, found [Here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt).
3. Edit the `main.py` to fit your own requirements
4. Run `main.py`
5. Enjoy playing as much wordle as you want, screw 24 hour limit!
